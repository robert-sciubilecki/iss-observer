This project is a straightforward exercise inspired by the '100 days of code' bootcamp led by Dr. Angela Yu. 
Although I didn't follow the course explanations step by step, the final result closely resembles the suggested outcome. 
It seems that simplicity kept it closely aligned with the course material.

I'm sharing it here because I find it quite cool, and I hope it can serve as inspiration for future projects.
